Opsworks HAPI Tutorial
======================

Step 1
------

This Repository contains a working hapi server that listens to Port 80.
(Opsworks will make sure that the server will listen to the correct domain)


To start this server you can simply start with:

```
$ sudo npm start
```

(```sudo``` is required because the server should run on port: 80)

Once started you should see "Hello World" when the server is up and running on:

http://localhost/
